    "# American Option Pricing for KO using Crank–Nicolson + PSOR\n",
    "\n",
    "An option is a contract that allows the buyer to either sell or purchase an asset on or before a specified date for a specified price. The particulars depend on the type of contract, with the most common being puts (sell) and call (buy) options for stocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several means of pricing these options exist, each with their own advantages. The Black-Scholes formula, formally introduced in 1973 by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, is the most popular and frequently used because of it's simplicity and practicallity. However, this same simplicity makes the model limited in it's capacity, as it is explicitly constructed to handle European options with a fixed exercise date and no dividend payouts. Consequently, since it's inception, a plethora of variants have been created to handle various types of contracts and computational issues which arise when pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus here will be American options which have both early exercise opportunities and dividend payouts. With the choice to exercise the contracts early, the option pricing problem becomes an optimisation problem. Specifically, it becomes a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) with the goal of maximising the price of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will start by converting the Black-Scholes formula into a partial differential equation (PDE) as this enables us to use numerical methods and handle any payoff structure, unlike the closed form which only uses European options. From there, an early exercise contraint is added to ensure the price of the contract is always greater than the payoff. The asset price - strike price grid will then be discretised so that the Crank-Nicolson may be used. The most common solver for the LCP resulting from Crank-Nicolson finite difference discretization of the American option Black-Scholes equation is the Projected Successive Over-Relaxation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that though the Black-Scholes was constructed for option pricing, it is most frequently used to evaluate market sentiment through the implied volatilty. However, that is beyond the scope of this work, as I will exclusively be looking at estimating the price of American options."
