The idea is to create a balanced and optimised portfolio. Unlike previous projects for the investment and finance, I will be using a live trading account to test these strategies. No API, this is simply optimisation. Robinhood will be used as the broker of choice because of their 0% commission.

First and most importantly, the objective function is to maximise profit. 
The second matter is concerning diversification. Constraints will be used the primary form of loss minimisation. 
Thirdly, a weighted portfolio will be used with consistent rebalancing. 
  - A main file will be used for strategy
  - Then new files will be uploaded to show results
